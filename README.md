This is my first python app which is crowel youtube data

DB will be in the 'db/scripts', 'db/rollback' files, I used MySQL DB, and SQLALCHEMY for ORM

To getting videos data I used Beautifulsoap to fetch data with commen identifiers (I tried another sol but it doesn't work fine with me)

To periodically update data, I used schedulers to run every 1 hour

Image thumbnail saved in images/ path 

note:
I don't know why Beautifulsoap doesn't fetch all videos on the page, I investigated and searched a lot of time to know why and how to solve it and I tried another ways 
but all thy way I tried give me the same result, and I can't fix it !!, if any one knows why please let me know
